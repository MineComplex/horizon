//! Crafting for LAN guests: the inventory's 2x2 grid (window 0) and the

//! (`horizon_client::menu`, `Kind::Inventory` / `Kind::Crafting`) over the
//! guest's inventory, with vanilla's packets: OpenScreen, container clicks
//! and their corrections, and the grid back into the inventory when the menu
//! closes (`AbstractContainerMenu.clearContainer`).
