//! Mobs and the guests of an open world. The mob code sees one player
//! (`MobWorld.player`, `Who::Player`); with guests on, each mob sees the
//! player vanilla's `Level.getNearestPlayer` would give it, and keeps the
//! guest it targets until it lets go. What it then does to `Who::Player`
//! (hits, pushes, fire, its projectiles) runs with that guest swapped in.
